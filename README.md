## WebScrapingToBuyCar

This project, completed in 2016 as part of the Advanced Python course at Maktabkhooneh, aims to estimate car prices in Iran and provide a listing of available cars for purchase. The car prices are sourced from https://bama.ir/. Our system supports all car brands and models available on Bama's platform.

With this project, you have two options:

  - Find your customized car along with its price.
  - Utilize AI for car price estimation.
